# Welcome to MiniFlow

This is a very basic version of the deep learning library Tensorflow. I did this exercise as part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

I am writing it up here to cement my understanding as well as to provide some value to whoever might read this. I therefore try to provide some explanation as to what's going on so that you might get a better (simple) understanding of what's going under the hood of tensorflow. My explanations are not super in depth as I assume prior knowledge of how Neural Networks work so the explanations act as more of a refresher. Even if you don't have that knowledge though, you may still get some value from this :)
